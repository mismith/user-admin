# User Admin

Barebones but extensible user admin panel


## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser (it will even work if served from the file system)
2. Login (using email `test@test.com` and password `testing`, by default)
3. Select, edit, delete, and/or add users (changes will be reflected on page, but will not persist, by default)


## Features

* [Material Design](https://material.io/design/) components via [vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify), so easily themeable
* Batch editing (and deleting) with made-changes-only updating
* Table pagination for big data sets
* Real-time row filtering/searching
* Customizable columns/fields and input types
* Beginner-friendly and easily prototypable single-file architecture (with no local dependencies)
